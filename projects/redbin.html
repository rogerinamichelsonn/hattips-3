          <h2>Reduced Binary Numerals</h2>
          <small>originally uploaded 2025-May-4</small>
          <hr>
          <p>Reduced Binary (RedBin) numerals are a possible family of numeric notation system to describe quantities in base-2 with a higher numbering base (i.e. 'hexadecimal' or 'octal') while retaining enough visual information in each symbol to reconstruct the original binary sequence &mdash;facilitating conversion between bases.</p>
          <h3>Characterisics</h3>
          <p>Currently I have identified 4 distinc characterisics that can identify any Reduced-Binary system.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Base</b>
              <p>Currently, it is impossible for me to determine a set of bases for which a Reduced Binary system is impossible to describe. Therefore, any RedBin system should be able to be identified by it base index.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>One-Zero Glyphs</b>
              <p>With simple RedBin systems the glyphs chosen for quantities of one and zero would constitute a fundamental part of it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Continuity</b>
              <p>Wether or not each glyps is made of conected strokes or is divided in different, separate, sections.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Orientation</b>
              <p>The side and way in which the glyphs need to be interpreted in order to reconstruct the original sequence.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Construction</h3>
          <h3>The 'Sandwich' Rule</h3>
          <p>The 'sandwich' rule is a way to improve the design of the glyphs in the specific case of a zero being 'sandwiched' between 2 ones, in this case the rule specifies that the zero is represented by an alternate glyph. The sandwich rule could also refer to a sandwhiched one but this case should be specified as is not taken as default.</p>
